 *	RecentlyUsedCache

 *	RecentlyUsedCache is a persistent cache that provides thumbnails for recently
 *	used documents in PDFNet.  The cache is stored in the PDFNet Resources folder,
 *	which can be set by calling PDFNet::SetPersistentCachePath. The cache will be used by
 *	any PDFNet process that uses the resource path.  If more than one PDFNet process
 *	is running concurrently, the first process to acquire a lock on the cache will
 *	use it.  Subsequent processes will not read or modify the cache.
 *
 *	Recently used cache will track the order of N recently used documents, and store
 *	references to generated PNG thumbnails for those documents.  Most of this functionality
 *	happens 'magically', without any necessary user action.
 *
