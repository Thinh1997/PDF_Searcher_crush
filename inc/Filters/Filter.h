/**
 * Provides a generic view of a sequence of bytes. 
 * 
 * A Filter is the abstract base class of all filters. A filter is an abstraction of 
 * a sequence of bytes, such as a file, an input/output device, an inter-process communication 
 * pipe, or a TCP/IP socket. The Filter class and its derived classes provide a generic view 
 * of these different types of input and output, isolating the programmer from the specific 
 * details of the operating system and the underlying devices.
 * 
 * Besides providing access to input/output sources Filters can be also to transform the data
 * (e.g. to compress the data stream, to normalize the image data, to encrypt data, etc).
 * Filters can also be attached to each other to form pipelines. For example, a filter used to 
 * open an image data file can be attached to a filter that decompresses the data, which is 
 * attached to another filter that will normalize the image data.
 * 
 * Depending on the underlying data source or repository, filters might support only some of 
 * these capabilities. An application can query a stream for its capabilities by using the 
 * IsInputFilter() and CanSeek() properties.
 * 
 * @note To read or write data to a filter, a user will typically use FilterReader/FilterWriter class.
 * instead of using Filter methods
 *
 * For example:
 * @code
 * StdFile file("my_stream.txt", StdFile::e_read_mode);
 * FilterReader reader(file);
 * while (reader.Read(..)) ...
 * @endcode
