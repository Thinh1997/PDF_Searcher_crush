/** 
 * SDFDoc is a low-level document representing a graph of SDF::Obj nodes that 
 * can be used to build higher-level document models such as PDF (Portable Document
 * Format) or FDF (Forms Document Format).
 * 
 * SDFDoc brings together document security, document utility methods, and all SDF 
 * objects.
 * 
 * A SDF document can be created from scratch using a default constructor:
 * 
 * SDFDoc mydoc;
 * Obj trailer = mydoc.GetTrailer();
 * 
 * SDF document can be also created from an existing file (e.g. an external PDF document): 
 * @code
 * SDFDoc mydoc("in.pdf");
 * Obj trailer = mydoc.GetTrailer();
 * @endcode
 * or from a memory buffer or some other Filter/Stream such as a HTTP Filter connection: 
 * 
 * @code
 * MemoryFilter memory = ....
 * SDFDoc mydoc(memory);
 * Obj trailer = mydoc.GetTrailer();
 * @endcode
 * 
 * Finally SDF document can be accessed from a high-level PDF document as follows: 
 * 
 * @code
 * PDFDoc doc("in.pdf");
 * SDFDoc& mydoc = doc.GetSDFDoc();
 * Obj trailer = mydoc.GetTrailer();
 * @endcode
 * 
 * Note that the examples above used doc.GetTrailer() in order to access document 
 * trailer, the starting SDF object (root node) in every document. Following the trailer 
 * links, it is possible to visit all low-level objects in a document (e.g. all pages, 
 * outlines, fonts, etc). 
 * 
 * SDFDoc also provides utility methods used to import objects and object collections 
 * from one document to another. These methods can be useful for copy operations between 
 * documents such as a high-level page merge and document assembly.
