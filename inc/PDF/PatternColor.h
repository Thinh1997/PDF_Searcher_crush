/**
 * Patterns are quite general, and have many uses; for example, they can be used 
 * to create various graphical textures, such as weaves, brick walls, sunbursts, 
 * and similar geometrical and chromatic effects.

 * Patterns are specified in a special family of color spaces named Pattern, whose
 * 'color values' are PatternColor objects instead of the numeric component values 
 * used with other spaces. Therefore PatternColor is to pattern color space what is 
 * ColorPt to all other color spaces.
 * 
 * A tiling pattern consists of a small graphical figure called a pattern cell. 
 * Painting with the pattern replicates the cell at fixed horizontal and vertical 
 * intervals to fill an area. The effect is as if the figure were painted on the 
 * surface of a clear glass tile, identical copies of which were then laid down 
 * in an array covering the area and trimmed to its boundaries. This is called 
 * tiling the area.
 * 
 * The pattern cell can include graphical elements such as filled areas, text, 
 * and sampled images. Its shape need not be rectangular, and the spacing of 
 * tiles can differ from the dimensions of the cell itself.
 * 
 * The order in which individual tiles (instances of the cell) are painted is 
 * unspecified and unpredictable; it is inadvisable for the figures on adjacent 
 * tiles to overlap.
