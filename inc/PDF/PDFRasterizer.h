	 * Draws the page into a given memory buffer.
	 * 
	 * @note This method is available on all platforms and in all 
	 * rasterizer implementations.
	 * 
	 * @param page The page to rasterize. 
	 * @param in_out_image_buffer A pointer to a memory buffer. The buffer must contain 
	 * at least (stride * height) bytes.
	 * @param width The width of the target image in pixels.
	 * @param height The height of the target image in pixels (the number of rows).
	 * @param stride Stride determines the physical width (in bytes) of one row in memory. 
	 * If this value is negative the direction of the Y axis is inverted. The absolute 
	 * value of stride is of importance, because it allows rendering in buffers where
	 * rows are padded in memory (e.g. in Windows bitmaps are padded on 4 byte boundaries). 
	 * Besides allowing rendering on the whole buffer stride parameter can be used 
	 * for rendering in a rectangular subset of a buffer.
	 * @param num_comps The number (4 or 5) representing the number of color components 
	 * in the device color space. For BGR+Alpha set this parameter to 4, and for CMYK+Alpha use 5. 
	 * If other values are set, exceptions will be thrown.
	 * @param demult - Specifies if the alpha is de-multiplied from the resulting color components. 
	 * @param device_mtx Device transformation matrix that maps PDF page from PDF user space 
	 * into device coordinate space (e.g. pixel space). PDF user space is represented in 
	 * page units, where one unit corresponds to 1/72 of an inch.
	 * @param clip Optional parameter defining the clip region for the page. If the parameter
	 *  is null or is not specified, PDFRasterizer uses page's crop box as a default clip region.
	 * @param scrl_clp_regions Optional parameter reserved for a future use.
	 * @param cancel An optional variable that can be used to stop the rendering thread. 
	 * 
	 *
	 * Sample code:
	 * @code
	 *   float drawing_scale = 2: 
	 *   Common::Matrix2D mtx(drawing_scale, 0, 0, drawing_scale, 0, 0);
	 *   PDF::Rect bbox(page.GetMediaBox());
	 *   bbox.Normalize();
	 *   int width = int(bbox.Width() * drawing_scale); 
	 *   int height = int(bbox.Height() * drawing_scale);
	 * 
	 *   // Stride is represented in bytes and is aligned on 4 byte 
	 *   // boundary so that you can render directly to GDI bitmap.
	 *   // A negative value for stride can be used to flip the image 
	 *   // upside down.
	 *   int comps = 4;  // for BGRA
	 *   int stride = ((width * comps + 3) / 4) * 4;
	 *
	 *   // buf is a memory buffer containing at least (stride*height) bytes.
	 * 	 memset(ptr, 0xFF, height*stride);  // Clear the background to opaque white paper color.
