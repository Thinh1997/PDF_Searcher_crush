/**
 *	DocumentPreviewCache
 *
 *	DocumentPreviewCache is a persistent cache that provides thumbnails for browsing in PDFNet.
 *   The cache is placed in the sub-directory 'trn_DocumentPreviewCache' of the PDFNet Resources folder,
 *   which can be set by calling PDFNet::SetPersistentCachePath. In the case the
 *   PersistentCachePath is not set the files will be stored in the system temp path
 *   (PDFNet::GetSystemTempPath()). The cache will be used by any PDFNet process that
 *	uses the resource path.  If more than one PDFNet process is running concurrently,
 *	the first process to acquire a lock on the cache will use it.  Subsequent processes
 *	will not read or modify the cache.
 *
 *	DocumentPreviewCache will store references to generated JPG thumbnails and keeps track of
 *   the dimensions of the thumbnail and the filesize of the specific pdf documents.
 *   Furthermore it takes care that the size constraints (max_cache_bytes, max_disk_percentage)
 *   are met and in cleans the oldest (in terms of last request) thumbs from the cache
 *   in case of a overflow.
 *
 *   If the user requests a file that is already in the cache and the requested thumb dimensions
 *   are smaller or equal than the ones of the cache-version the URL of the cached thumb is given
 *   back. If the dimensions are bigger the thumb gets rendered again, the old thumb gets
 *   replaced and the URL is given back.
 *
 *   If the size of the pdf document changes the thumb will be rendered again even when there is
 *   a version of that thumbnail in the cache. In case that the user wants to suppress the
 *   re-rendering of that specific thumb (e.g. when the change on the pdf document was made
 *   on another page than the first page which is used for the thumb), IrrelevantChangeMade has to
 *	be called.
