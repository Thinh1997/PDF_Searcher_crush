/**
 * The OCG::Group object represents an optional-content group. This corresponds
 * to a PDF OCG dictionary representing a collection of graphic objects that can 
 * be made visible or invisible (Section 4.10.1 'Optional Content Groups' in PDF 
 * Reference). Any graphic content of the PDF can be made optional, including page 
 * contents, XObjects, and annotations. The specific content objects in the group 
 * have an OC entry in the PDF as part of the surrounding marked content or in the 
 * XObject dictionary. The group itself is a named object that can be typically 
 * manipulated through a Layers panel in a PDF viewer.
 * <p>
 * In the simplest case, the group's ON-OFF state makes the associated content 
 * visible or hidden. The ON-OFF state of a group can be toggled for a particular 
 * context (OCG::Context), and a set of states is kept in a configuration (OCG::Config). 
 * The visibility can depend on more than one group in an optional-content membership 
 * dictionary (OCG::OCMD), and can also be affected by the context's draw mode
 * (OCGContext::OCDrawMode).
 * </p><p>
 * A group has an Intent entry, broadly describing the intended use. A group's 
 * content is considered to be optional (that is, the group's state is considered in 
 * its visibility) if any intent in its list matches an intent of the context. The 
 * intent list of the context is usually set from the intent list of the document 
 * configuration.
 * </p><p>
 * A Usage dictionary entry provides more specific intended usage information than 
 * an intent entry. Possible key values are: CreatorInfo, Language, Export, Zoom,
 * Print, View, User, PageElement. The usage value can act as a kind of metadata, 
 * describing the sort of things that belong to the group, such as text in French, 
 * fine detail on a map, or a watermark. The usage values can also be used by the 
 * AutoState mechanism to make decisions about what groups should be on and what 
 * groups should be off. The AutoState mechanism considers the usage information 
 * in the OCGs, the AS array of the configuration, and external factors; for example, 
 * the language the application is running in, the current zoom level on the page, 
 * or whether the page is being printed.
