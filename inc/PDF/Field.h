/**
 * An interactive form (sometimes referred to as an AcroForm) is a 
 * collection of fields for gathering information interactively from 
 * the user. A PDF document may contain any number of Fields appearing 
 * on any combination of pages, all of which make up a single, global 
 * interactive form spanning the entire document.
 * 
 * PDFNet fully supports reading, writing, and editing PDF forms and 
 * provides many utility methods so that work with forms is simple and 
 * efficient. Using PDFNet forms API arbitrary subsets of form fields 
 * can be imported or exported from the document, new forms can be 
 * created from scratch, and the appearance of existing forms can be 
 * modified. 
 * 
 * In PDFNet Fields are accessed through FieldIterator-s. The list of 
 * all Fields present in the document can be traversed as follows:
 * 
 * @code
 * FieldIterator itr = pdfdoc.GetFieldIterator();
 * for(; itr.HasNext(); itr.Next()) {
 *   Field field = itr.Current();
 *   Console.WriteLine("Field name: {0}", field.GetName());
 *  }
 * @endcode 
 * 
 * For a full sample, please refer to 'InteractiveForms' sample project.
 * 
 * To search field by name use FieldFind method. For example:
 * @code
 * FieldIterator itr = pdfdoc.FieldFind("name");
 * if (itr.HasNext()) {
 *   Console.WriteLine("Field name: {0}", itr.Current().GetName());
 * }
 * else { ...field was not found... }
 * @endcode 
 * 
 * If a given field name was not found or if the end of the field list 
 * was reached the iterator HasNext() will return false.
 *
 * If you have a valid iterator you can access the Field using Current() method. For example: 
 * Field field = itr.Current();
 *
 * Using Flatten(...) method it is possible to merge field 
 * appearances with the page content. Form 'flattening' refers to the 
 * operation that changes active form fields into a static area that is  
 * part of the PDF document, just like the other text and images in 
 * the document. A completely flattened PDF form does not have any 
 * widget annotations or interactive fields.

	 * Flags specifying various characteristics of the fields.
	 * 
	 * Field flags common to all field types: 
	 * ----------------------------------------------
	 * - If e_read_only flag is set the user may not change the value 
	 * of the field. Any associated widget annotations will not interact with 
	 * the user; that is, they will not respond to mouse clicks or change their 
	 * appearance in response to mouse motions. This flag is useful for fields 
	 *  whose values are computed or imported from a database.
   	 *
	 * - If e_required flag is set, the field must have a value at the time 
	 * it is exported by a submit-form action.
	 *
	 * - If e_no_export flag is set, the field must not be exported by a 
	 * submit-form action.
	 * 
	 * Field flags specific to radio buttons: 
	 * ----------------------------------------------
	 * - If e_toggle_to_off is clear, exactly one radio button must be selected 
	 * at all times; clicking the currently selected button has no effect. 
	 * If set, clicking the selected button deselects it, leaving no button selected.
	 * 
	 * - If e_radios_in_unison is set, a group of radio buttons within a radio button 
	 * field that use the same value for the on state will turn on and off in unison; 
	 * that is if one is checked, they are all checked. If clear, the buttons are 
	 * mutually exclusive (the same behavior as HTML radio buttons).
	 * 
	 * Field flags specific to text fields: 
	 * ----------------------------------------------
	 * - If e_multiline is set, the field can contain multiple lines of text; 
	 * if clear, the field's text is restricted to a single line.
	 * 
	 * - If e_password If set, the field is intended for entering a secure password 
	 * that should not be echoed visibly to the screen. Characters typed from the 
	 * keyboard should instead be echoed in some unreadable form, such as asterisks 
	 * or bullet characters. The value is not stored if this flag is set.
	 * 
	 * - If e_file_select is set, the text entered in the field represents the pathname 
	 * of a file whose contents are to be submitted as the value of the field.
	 * 
	 * - If e_no_spellcheck is set, text entered in the field is not spell-checked.
 	 *  
	 * - If e_no_scroll is set, the field does not scroll (horizontally for single-line 
	 * fields, vertically for multiple-line fields) to accommodate more text than fits
	 * within its annotation rectangle. Once the field is full, no further text is 
	 * accepted.
	 * 
	 * - If e_comb is set, the field is automatically divided into as many equally
	 * spaced positions, or combs, as the value of MaxLen, and the text is laid out
	 * into those combs. Meaningful only if the MaxLen entry is present in the text 
	 * field and if the Multiline, Password, and FileSelect flags are clear. 
	 * 
	 * - If e_rich_text is set, the value of this field should be represented as a rich 
	 * text string. If the field has a value, the RV entry of the field dictionary 
	 * specifies the rich text string.
	 * 
	 * Field flags specific to choice fields: 
	 * ----------------------------------------------
	 * 
	 * - If e_combo is set, the field is a combo box; 
	 * if clear, the field is a list box.
	 * 
	 * - If e_edit is set, the combo box includes an editable text box as well as a 
	 * dropdown list; if clear, it includes only a drop-down list. This flag is 
	 * meaningful only if the e_combo flag is set.
	 * 
	 * - If e_sort is set, the field's option items should be sorted alphabetically. 
	 * This flag is intended for use by form authoring tools, not by PDF viewer 
	 * applications. Viewers should simply display the options in the order in
	 * which they occur in the Opt array.
	 * 
	 * - If e_multiselect is set, more than one of the field's option items may be 
	 * selected simultaneously; if clear, no more than one item at a time may be
	 * selected.
	 * 
	 * - If e_commit_on_sel_change is set, the new value is committed as soon as a 
	 * selection is made with the pointing device. This option enables applications 
	 * to perform an action once a selection is made, without requiring the user
	 * to exit the field. If clear, the new value is not committed until the user
	 * exits the field.
