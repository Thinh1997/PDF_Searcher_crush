/** 
 * A redaction annotation (PDF 1.7) identifies content that is intended to 
 * be removed from the document. The intent of redaction annotations is to 
 * enable the following:
 * a)Content identification. A user applies redact annotations that specify 
 * the pieces or regions of content that should be removed. Up until the 
 * next step is performed, the user can see, move and redefine these 
 * annotations.
 * b)Content removal. The user instructs the viewer application to apply 
 * the redact annotations, after which the content in the area specified 
 * by the redact annotations is removed. In the removed content's place, 
 * some marking appears to indicate the area has been redacted. Also, the 
 * redact annotations are removed from the PDF document.
 * Redaction annotations provide a mechanism for the first step in the 
 * redaction process (content identification). This allows content to be 
 * marked for redaction in a non-destructive way, thus enabling a review 
 * process for evaluating potential redactions prior to removing the 
 * specified content.
 * Redaction annotations shall provide enough information to be used 
 * in the second phase of the redaction process (content removal). 
 * This phase is application-specific and requires the conforming reader 
 * to remove all content identified by the redaction annotation, as well 
 * as the annotation itself.
 * Conforming readers that support redaction annotations shall provide 
 * a mechanism for applying content removal, and they shall remove all 
 * traces of the specified content. If a portion of an image is contained 
 * in a redaction region, that portion of the image data shall be destroyed; 
 * clipping or image masks shall not be used to hide that data. 
 * Such conforming readers shall also be diligent in their consideration 
 * of all content that can exist in a PDF document, including XML Forms 
 * Architecture (XFA) content and Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) 
 * content.
