/**
 * Markup is a base class for a number of annotations types that 
 * are used to mark up PDF documents. These annotations have text that 
 * appears as part of the annotation and may be displayed in other ways by a 
 * conforming reader, such as in a Comments pane.
 * Markup annotations may be divided into the following groups:
 * - Free text annotations display text directly on the page. 
 *   The annotation's Contents entry specifies the displayed text.
 * - Most other markup annotations have an associated pop-up window 
 *   that may contain text. The annotation's Contents entry specifies 
 *   the text that shall be displayed when the pop-up window is opened. 
 *   These include text, line, square, circle, polygon, polyline, 
 *   highlight,underline, squiggly-underline, strikeout, rubber stamp, 
 *   caret, ink, and file attachment annotations.
 * - Sound annotations do not have a pop-up window but may also have 
 *   associated text specified by the Contents entry.
 * - A subset of markup annotations are intended to markup text of a 
 *   document (e.g. highlight, strikeout, jagged, underline) and they 
 *   are derived from TextMarkup base class.
 * 
 * @note The pop-up annotation type must not appear by itself; it must be 
 * associated with a markup annotation that uses it to display text.
 *
 * The meaning of an annotation's Contents entry varies by annotation type. 
 * Typically, it is the text that shall be displayed for the annotation or, 
 * if the annotation does not display text, an alternate description of the 
 * annotation's contents in human-readable form. When separating text into 
 * paragraphs, a CARRIAGE RETURN (0Dh) must be used.
