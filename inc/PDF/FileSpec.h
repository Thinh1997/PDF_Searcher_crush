/** 
 * FileSpec corresponds to the PDF file specification object. 
 * 
 * A PDF file can refer to the contents of another file by using a file specification, 
 * which can take either of the following forms:
 * 
 * - A simple file specification gives just the name of the target file in 
 *   a standard format, independent of the naming conventions of any particular file system. 
 * 
 * - A full file specification includes information related to one or more specific file
 *   systems.
 * 
 * - A URL reference.
 *
 * Although the file designated by a file specification is normally external to the
 * PDF file referring to it, it is also possible to embed the file allowing its contents 
 * to be stored or transmitted along with the PDF file. However, embedding a file does not 
 * change the presumption that it is external to (or separate from) the PDF file.
 * 
 * For more details on file specifications, please refer to Section 3.10, 'File Specifications'
 * in the PDF Reference Manual.
