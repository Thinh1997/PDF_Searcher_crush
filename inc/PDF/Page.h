	 * PDF page can define as many as five separate boundaries to control various aspects of the 
	 * imaging process (for more details please refer to Section 10.10.1 'Page Boundaries' in PDF 
	 * Reference Manual):
	 *
	 * - The media box defines the boundaries of the physical medium on which the page is to be 
	 * printed. It may include any extended area surrounding the finished page for bleed, printing 
	 * marks, or other such purposes. It may also include areas close to the edges of the medium 
	 * that cannot be marked because of physical limitations of the output device. Content falling 
	 * outside this boundary can safely be discarded without affecting the meaning of the PDF file.
	 * 
	 * - The crop box defines the region to which the contents of the page are to be clipped (cropped) 
	 * when displayed or printed. Unlike the other boxes, the crop box has no defined meaning in 
	 * terms of physical page geometry or intended use; it merely imposes clipping on the page 
	 * contents. The default value is the page's media box.
	 * 
	 * - The bleed box defines the region to which the contents of the page should be clipped when 
	 * output in a production environment. This may include any extra bleed area needed to 
	 * accommodate the physical limitations of cutting, folding, and trimming equipment. 
	 * The default value is the page's crop box.
	 * 
	 * - The trim box defines the intended dimensions of the finished page after trimming. It may 
	 * be smaller than the media box to allow for production related content, such as printing 
	 * instructions, cut marks, or color bars. The default value is the page's crop box.
	 * 
	 * - The art box defines the extent of the page's meaningful content (including potential 
	 * white space) as intended by the page's creator. The default value is the page's crop box.
	 *
	 * - The user crop box defines a custom region to which the contents of the
	 * page are to be clipped (cropped) when displayed by PDFNet
	 * It must be fully contained within the e_crop box.
	 * The default value is the page's crop box.
