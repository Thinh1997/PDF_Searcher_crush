/**
 * Shading is a class that represents a flat interface around all PDF shading types: 
 *
 *  - In Function-based (type 1) shadings, the color at every point in 
 *    the domain is defined by a specified mathematical function. The function need 
 *    not be smooth or continuous. This is the most general of the available shading 
 *    types, and is useful for shadings that cannot be adequately described with any 
 *    of the other types. 
 *
 *  - Axial shadings (type 2) define a color blend along a line between two points,
 *    optionally extended beyond the boundary points by continuing the boundary
 *    colors.
 * 
 *  - Radial shadings (type 3) define a color blend that varies between two circles.
 *    Shadings of this type are commonly used to depict three-dimensional spheres
 *    and cones.
 *
 *  - Free-form Gouraud-shaded triangle mesh shadings (type 4) and lattice Gouraud 
 *    shadings (type 5) are commonly used to represent complex colored and shaded 
 *    three-dimensional shapes. The area to be shaded is defined by a path composed entirely 
 *    of triangles. The color at each vertex of the triangles is specified, and a technique 
 *    known as Gouraud interpolation is used to color the interiors. The interpolation 
 *    functions defining the shading may be linear or nonlinear.
 *
 *  - Coons patch mesh shadings (type 6) are constructed from one or more color
 *    patches, each bounded by four cubic Bezier curves.
 * 
 *    A Coons patch generally has two independent aspects:
 *    - Colors are specified for each corner of the unit square, and bilinear 
 *      interpolation is used to fill in colors over the entire unit square<BR>
 *    - Coordinates are mapped from the unit square into a four-sided patch whose
 *      sides are not necessarily linear. The mapping is continuous: the corners 
 *      of the unit square map to corners of the patch and the sides of the unit 
 *      square map to sides of the patch.
 *
 *  - Tensor-product patch mesh shadings (type 7) are identical to type 6 
 *    (Coons mesh), except that they are based on a bicubic tensor-product 
 *    patch defined by 16 control points, instead of the 12 control points 
 *    that define a Coons patch. The shading Patterns dictionaries representing 
 *    the two patch types differ only in the value of the Type entry and 
 *    in the number of control points specified for each patch in the data stream. 
 *    Although the Coons patch is more concise and easier to use, the tensor-
 *    product patch affords greater control over color mapping.
