/**
 * Flattener is a optional PDFNet add-on that can be used to simplify and optimize 
 * existing PDF's to render faster on devices with lower memory and speeds.
 * 
 * PDF documents can frequently contain very complex page description (e.g. 
 * thousands of paths, different shadings, color spaces, blend modes, large images 
 * etc.) that may not be suitable for interactive viewing on mobile devices.
 * Flattener can be used to speed-up PDF rendering on mobile devices and on the Web 
 * by simplifying page content (e.g. flattening complex graphics into images) while 
 * maintaining vector text whenever possible.
 *
 * By using the FlattenMode::e_simple option each page in the PDF will be
 * reduced to a single background image, with the remaining text over top in vector
 * format. Some text may still get flattened, in particular any text that is clipped, 
 * or underneath, other content that will be flattened.
 *
 * On the other hand the FlattenMode::e_fast will not flatten simple content, such
 * as simple straight lines, nor will it flatten Type3 fonts.
 * 
 * @note 'Flattener' is available as a separately licensable add-on to PDFNet 
 * core license.
 * 
 * @note See 'pdftron.PDF.Optimizer' for alternate approach to optimize PDFs with 
 * focus on file size reduction.
