{
public:

	/**
	 * Create and embed an Image from an external file taking into account specified 
	 * compression hints. 
	 *
	 * By default the function will either pass-through data preserving the original 
	 * compression or will compress data using Flate compression. It is possible to 
	 * fine tune compression or to select a different compression algorithm using 
	 * 'encoder_hints' object.
	 * 
	 * @param doc - A document to which the image should be added. To obtain 
	 * SDF::Doc from PDFDoc use PDFDoc::GetSDFDoc() or Obj::GetDoc().
	 * 
	 * @param filename - The name of the image file. Currently supported formats are 
	 * JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, BMP, EMF, and WMF. Other raster formats can be embedded by 
	 * decompressing image data and using other versions of Image::Create(...) method.
	 *
	 * @param encoder_hints - An optional SDF::Obj containing a hint (or an SDF::Array of 
	 * hints) that could be used to select a specific compression method and compression 
	 * parameters. For a concrete example of how to create encoder hints, please take a look 
	 * at JBIG2Test and AddImage sample projects. The image encoder accepts the following 
	 * hints:
	 * 
	 *  - /JBIG2; SDF::Name("JBIG2"), An SDF::Name Object with value equal to "JBIG2". If the 
	 *	image is monochrome (i.e. bpc == 1), the encoder will compress the image using JBIG2Decode 
	 *	filter.
	 *	Note that JBIG2 compression is not recommended for use on scanned text/financial documents or equivalent
	 *  since its lossless nature can lead to similar looking numbers or characters being replaced.
	 *
	 *  - [/JBIG2 /Threshold 0.6 /SharePages 50] - Compress a monochrome image using lossy JBIG2Decode 
	 *  compression with the given image threshold and by sharing segments from a specified number 
	 *  of pages. The threshold is a floating point number in the range from 0.4 to 0.9. Increasing the threshold 
	 *  value will increase image quality, but may increase the file size. The default value 
	 *  for threshold is 0.85. "SharePages" parameter can be used to specify the maximum number of 
	 *  pages sharing a common 'JBIG2Globals' segment stream. Increasing the value of this parameter 
	 *  improves compression ratio at the expense of memory usage.
	 *
	 *	- [/CCITT] - Compress a monochrome (i.e. bpc == 1) image using CCITT Group 4 compression. This algorithm typically produces 
	 *				larger output than JBIG2, but is lossless. This makes it much more suitable for scanned text documents.
	 *				CCITT is the best option for more general monochrome compression use cases, since JBIG2 has potential to change image content. 
	 *	
	 *  - [/JPEG] - Use JPEG compression with default compression. 
	 *  - [/JPEG /Quality 60] - Use JPEG compression with given quality setting. The "Quality" 
	 *	value is expressed on the 0..100 scale.
	 *
	 *  - [/JPEG2000] - Use JPEG2000 compression to compress a RGB or a grayscale image.</para>
	 *
	 *  - [/JP2] - Use JPEG2000 compression with JP2 encoding. JP2 does not support CMYK images.</para>
	 *
	 *  - [/Flate] - Use Flate compression with maximum compression at the expense of 
	 *	speed. 
	 *
	 *  - [/Flate /Level 9] - Use Flate compression using specified compression level. 
	 *	Compression "Level" must be a number between 0 and 9: 1 gives best speed, 
	 *	9 gives best compression, 0 gives no compression at all (the input data is simply 
	 *	copied a block at a time). 
	 *
	 *  - /RAW or [/RAW] - The encoder will not use any compression method and the image 
	 *	will be stored in the raw format.
	 * 
	 * @return PDF::Image object representing the embedded image.
	 * @note For C++ developers: Current document does not take the ownership of the 
	 * encoder_hints object. Therefore it is a good programming practice to create 
	 * encoder_hints object on the stack.
